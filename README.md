# Robocup-2025


## What is Robocup?
[Robocup Junior Soccer Open](https://junior.robocup.org/soccer/) is a league of the international robotic competition: [RoboCup](https://robocup.org).
For this competition, we need to create _two fully autonomous robots_ that play _soccer_ against other teams. We have to design, build and program the robots without external help. This is a really challenging problem because the robots need to be fully autonomous. They need to detect the ball and try to go towards it to hopefully push it towards the goal. A camera system is needed to try to detect the ball based on its color (it's an orange golf ball) and to detect the opponent's goal.

## The robots

The robots were built with individual components we found online, that we meshed together using communication protocols such as uart. The frames were 3d printed, and the cone was manufactured with CNC machining.

## The team
We're a team of 3 high school students from Bordeaux.
