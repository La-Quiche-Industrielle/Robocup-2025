As is rather common with robotics competitions and larger projects, code and other pieces of data aren't often well archived on the spurr of the moment. During competitions, we are often concentrated on getting a version of the code that's working with the current situations rather than saving which versions we used. We therefor can't show one program that represents our robots' code. Many versions have been changed numerous times, and code often changed from one match to the next. In any case, this is the code that has the main components of the code that gave us a goal in six seconds.
